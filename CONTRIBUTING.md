# Contributing Guidelines

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Modern Swarm Leader-Follower System. This document outlines the development guidelines, contribution process, and best practices for maintaining code quality.

## Development Philosophy

### Code Quality Standards
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- **Modularity**: Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Testability**: All code should be testable and include appropriate tests
- **Documentation**: Code should be properly documented with clear comments

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep different functionalities in separate modules
- **Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different contexts
- **Extensibility**: New features should be added without breaking existing functionality
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of design decisions

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **ROS2 Installation**: Ensure ROS2 is properly installed and configured
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.8+ with required dependencies
3. **Development Tools**: Git, code editor, debugging tools

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd modern_swarm_leader_follower

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build ROS2 workspace
cd ros2_workspace
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
cd ..

# Set up Python path
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/demos/python
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and concise

### ROS2 Code Style
- Follow ROS2 naming conventions
- Use appropriate message types
- Implement proper error handling
- Include comprehensive logging

### Documentation Standards
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Document complex algorithms and design decisions
- Keep README and documentation files up to date
- Include examples for new features

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement Feature**
   - Follow coding standards
   - Include appropriate tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Test Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Test standalone Python components
   cd demos/python
   python your_feature_test.py
   
   # Test ROS2 integration
   cd ../../ros2_workspace
   colcon build
   ros2 run modern_swarm your_feature_node.py
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation files
   - Add usage examples
   - Update README if necessary

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Create detailed pull request description
   - Include testing instructions
   - Reference related issues

### Bug Fix Process

1. **Identify Issue**
   - Reproduce the bug consistently
   - Document steps to reproduce
   - Identify root cause

2. **Create Fix**
   - Implement minimal fix
   - Add regression tests
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Submit Fix**
   - Create pull request with fix description
   - Include test results
   - Reference issue number

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use appropriate testing frameworks (pytest recommended)
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- Test ROS2 integration thoroughly
- Verify communication between components
- Test performance under various conditions
- Validate error handling

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark new features against existing code
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Test scalability with different swarm sizes
- Document performance characteristics

### Test Structure
```

├── unit/           # Unit tests
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── performance/    # Performance tests
└── fixtures/       # Test data and fixtures
```
